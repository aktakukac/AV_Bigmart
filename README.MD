This repository contains my solutions for Analytics Vidhya - BigMart sales prediction data mining competition. For further details see link: <http://datahack.analyticsvidhya.com/contest/practice-problem-bigmart-sales-prediction>.

My solution resulted in an initial 42nd place.

The solution contains implementation with the following packages:

`XGBoost` </br>
`Caret and CaretEnsemble`</br>
`h2o`</br>

Some data discovery images are also added. 

I am still working on my solution so I will post additional solutions as I am happy with them.
